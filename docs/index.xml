      <description>My approach Functionality and simplicity. I believe, a great tool should feel like an extension of ourselves that helps us complete a task with as little effort as possible and at the same time help us enjoy the process. Like a well-designed set of kitchen tools and a balanced sharp knife can make our experience of making dinner relaxing and delightful.
Quality and details. I believe user experience is inseparable from the visual aspect of a digital product.</description>

      <description>Built I made it using a static site generator called Hugo - speed, security, simplicity. Nice blogging framework, requires a bit of coding, though.
Hosted I&#39;m hosting it on Github Pages straight from a repository on GitHub for free.
Type Typeset in Runda. It has the clarity and confidence that I think compliments my work.</description>

      <description>Update coming soonA more detailed version with minor changes  This post is largely about Product Design. If you are not sure what it is exactly, Eric Eriksson has your back with What is Product Design?. In a sentence, it’s about understanding the problem, designing a solution, shipping it and iterating until it solves the problem. It’s quite brief, so, in a way, it is just another boring sketches and mockups iteration article of which there’s a good number on Medium.</description>

The average employee spends 37% of their work time in meetings. When those meetings are ineffective, that adds up to a lot of wasted time and money.

FirstAgenda has taken a stand against unproductive meetings by developing the digital meeting solutions Prepare and Assistant. Their focus is to optimize all stages in the process of preparing for, organizing and following up on meetings.</description>

      <description>domesting.com↗︎  
Domesting is a web based platform that connects users to commercial and residential cleaning companies. The platform allows users to find and book services for domestic cleaning, cleaning of communities, offices, commercial premises, garages, and just about every other kind of cleaning and sanitation.

I was at Domesting for about 6 months from almost the very beginning doing everything: branding, UI/UX, front-end, print, etc. Just like it often happens in startups we were all trying to help the team succeed in every way we could.</description>

      <description>Tripopotamus was to be a one-stop-shop web travel platform that would allow to combine different components to create one&#39;s own perfect vacation.
Research shows that the path to purchase is complex, and traveler search activity is intensifying, an average customer making 32.5 visits to 10.3 websites before the order. Tripopotamus wanted to simplify this process believing that you need to spend less time on planning trips and more enjoying it.</description>

      <description>velvetropes.com↗︎  
Velvet Ropes is a digital multi-platform star map and a regularly updated source that you can use to learn about your favorite celebrities.
Velvet Ropes was created to fill a void - an easy way for people who love all things celebrity to navigate Hollywood for celebrity homes, hot spots and sightings that are combined in a one easy-to-use app.

How it started I joined in spring 2016 for a little under a year and was responsible for all design and direction.</description>

      <description>wiredrive.com↗︎App Store↗︎ 
Wiredrive is a cloud content management and collaboration solution for marketing and production teams.
I was called in to revamp the iOS apps and tasked to mainly focus on the UX and make sure the iPhone and the iPad app function perfectly. I just followed Apple&#39;s design guidelines and made all designs very close the those of iOS system apps.
How it started There already were functioning apps on both iPhone and iPad, but they were lacking in good UX and aesthetic of the interface.</description>
