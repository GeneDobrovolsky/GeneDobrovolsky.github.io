      <description>History Its started out as a hobby when I got into print design and typography. I took a course in graphic design and learned the basics of color, composition, typography, and how to apply it in branding. Then, around 5 years ago, I got interested in web design and shortly after that I started doing it for a living. Over the course on the next few years I gradually transitioned into UI/UX.</description>

      <description>This is not my first personal website. After a few years of having one that I updated maybe 2 or 3 times in a year I realised it was a bit of an overkill.
My previous website was on Wordpress and hosted on Mediatemple wich cost me 20$/month + 15$/year for the domain + throwing in 50$/year Typekit subscription, which is optional, but it was the case.
So, I was paying around $300 a year for something that was nice to have, but optional, since I was getting my jobs on Upwork or from my previous clients and their connections.</description>

      <description>This post is largely about Product Design. If you are not sure what it is exactly, Eric Eriksson has your back with What is Product Design?. In a sentence, it’s about understanding the problem, designing a solution, shipping it and iterating until it solves the problem. It’s quite brief, so, in a way, it is just another boring sketches and mockups iteration article of which there’s a good number on Medium.</description>

The average employee spends 37% of their work time in meetings. When those meetings are ineffective, that adds up to a lot of wasted time and money.
At FirstAgenda, we have taken a stand against unproductive meetings by developing the digital meeting solutions Prepare and Assistant. Our focus is to optimize all stages in the process of preparing for, organizing and following up on meetings.</description>

      <description>velvetropes.com↗︎  This is a previewFull case study coming soon.  
Velvet Ropes is a revolutionary development combining celebrity homes, hot spots and sightings into one easy-to-use app for people who love all things celebrity. Velvet Ropes was created to fill a massive void - an easy way to navigate celebrity homes, find celebrity hot spots and report &amp;amp; search real-time celebrity sightings! There are four &amp;quot;Star Maps&amp;quot; being sold in Los Angeles alone claiming to be &amp;quot;updated regularly&amp;quot;, but we found all 4 maps have completely different addresses for the same person in many cases - not to mention how out-dated paper maps are.</description>
