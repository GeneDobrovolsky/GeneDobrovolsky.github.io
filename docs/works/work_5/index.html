<p>The average employee spends 37% of their work time in meetings. When those meetings are ineffective, that adds up to a lot of wasted time and money.</p>

<p><figure class="col-md-8 col-xl-6 p-0"><img src="/images/work_5/4.jpg" alt=""></figure></p>

<p>FirstAgenda has taken a stand against unproductive meetings by developing the digital meeting solutions Prepare and Assistant. Their focus is to optimize all stages in the process of preparing for, organizing and following up on meetings.</p>

<p><figure class="col-sm-12 col-xl-8 p-0"><img src="/images/work_5/2.jpg" alt="" title="Assistant is focused on helping you during the meeting."><figcaption>Assistant is focused on helping you during the meeting.</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Assistant records not only the entire meeting, but your personal notes, public decisions, and tasks as well. Also, you can take photos and attach files. After the meeting ends you can listen to the entire meeting recording, jump to your bookmarks, search keywords and all their instances – the meeting is transcribed.</p>

<p><figure class="col-sm-12 col-xl-10 p-0"><img src="/images/work_5/6.jpg" alt="" title="Prepare on the iPad and Web helps you before and after meetings."><figcaption>Prepare on the iPad and Web helps you before and after meetings.</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Prepare does everything Assistant does, except it doesn't allow for speech recognition, which is where keyboard comes in. In addition it allows for uploading, organising, and collaborating on documents.</p>

<h3 id="the-early-days">The early days</h3>

<p>I joined the team in mid 2016 when there already was a web and an iPad app called Prepare that managed the basics of preparing before the meeting and collaborating after: meeting dates, attendees, attachments and documents, document comments and notes.</p>

<p><figure class="border col-md-8 col-xl-6 p-0"><img src="/images/work_5/3.png" alt="" title="It's a meeting page in Prepare app on an iPad, early 2016.  The web counterpart was identical and had the same functionality."><figcaption>It's a meeting page in Prepare app on an iPad, early 2016.  The web counterpart was identical and had the same functionality.</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>At that moment First Agenda already had 30K active users in 400 organisations across Scandinavia wich amounted to 10K monthly meetings. Now First Agenda wanted to provide a tool for when you were in a meeting - Assistant.</p>

<p>I started with Assistant, but later when we figured out the basic functionality and had a working prototype we started to think of it as a part of a one whole product and I was responsible for the UI/UX of it.</p>

<p>First Agenda received $17 Mill at some point after we rolled out our early version of Assistant and overhauled Prepare on the web. I continued to move the design towards a finished product.</p>

<h3 id="the-details">The details</h3>

<p>We've been through a lot of iteration and exploration. Eventually we stuck with the designs that would align with the Android and web app, although if we were building just an iOS app we would probably go with the FA iPhone 2b or similar. It's important that the user feels at home and the home is consistent throughout all devices.</p>

<p>The main flow is super simple. You start on your meetings list &gt; go to meeting &gt; everything you need is within one scroll.</p>

<p>Below on the left is the screen of a meeting that has ended and contains all kinds of content.</p>

<p><figure class="col-xl-8 p-0"><img src="/images/work_5/7.jpg" alt=""></figure></p>

<p>Before I got to these final designs I had done quite a lot of prototyping. We were figuring out the flows trying to make the app super simple, almost simplistic (InVision), and then trying to enhance the look and feel of the app with interactions (Framer).</p>
