The average employee spends 37% of their work time in meetings. When those meetings are ineffective, that adds up to a lot of wasted time and money.
At FirstAgenda, we have taken a stand against unproductive meetings by developing the digital meeting solutions Prepare and Assistant. Our focus is to optimize all stages in the process of preparing for, organizing and following up on meetings.</description>

Tripopotamus is a travel agency for each and every one. Searching for travel today is a time consuming process. Using our dynamic packages’ platform allows to reduce the time of package formation considerably. The platform is going to be experience oriented, budget-aware and will allow combine and countercheck different means of transportation and several destinations.


Unfortunately, Tripopotamus didn&#39;t make it, but we all learned from it, so it was totally worth it.</description>

      <description>velvetropes.com↗︎  This is a previewFull case study coming soon.  
Velvet Ropes is a revolutionary development combining celebrity homes, hot spots and sightings into one easy-to-use app for people who love all things celebrity. Velvet Ropes was created to fill a massive void - an easy way to navigate celebrity homes, find celebrity hot spots and report &amp;amp; search real-time celebrity sightings! There are four &amp;quot;Star Maps&amp;quot; being sold in Los Angeles alone claiming to be &amp;quot;updated regularly&amp;quot;, but we found all 4 maps have completely different addresses for the same person in many cases - not to mention how out-dated paper maps are.</description>
