      <description>My approach Functionality and simplicity. I believe, a great tool should feel like an extension of ourselves that helps us complete a task with as little effort as possible and at the same time help us enjoy the process. Like a well-designed set of kitchen tools and a balanced sharp knife can make our experience of making dinner relaxing and delightful.
Quality and details. I believe user experience is inseparable from the visual aspect of a digital product.</description>

      <description>Built I made it using a static site generator called Hugo - speed, security, simplicity. Nice blogging framework, requires a bit of coding, though.
Hosted I&#39;m hosting it on Github Pages straight from a repository on GitHub for free.
Type Typeset in Runda. It has the clarity and confidence that I think compliments my work.</description>
