      <description>History Its started out as a hobby when I got into print design and typography. I took a course in graphic design and learned the basics of color, composition, typography, and how to apply it in branding. Then, around 5 years ago, I got interested in web design and shortly after that I started doing it for a living. Over the course on the next few years I gradually transitioned into UI/UX.</description>

      <description>This is not my first personal website. After a few years of having one that I updated maybe 2 or 3 times in a year I realised it was a bit of an overkill.
My previous website was on Wordpress and hosted on Mediatemple wich cost me 20$/month + 15$/year for the domain + throwing in 50$/year Typekit subscription, which is optional, but it was the case.
So, I was paying around $300 a year for something that was nice to have, but optional, since I was getting my jobs on Upwork or from my previous clients and their connections.</description>
