    <h2 class="single-headline">Hey, my name is Eugene</h2>
    
    <h5 class="single-summary">I’m a Ukrainian UI/UX designer focusing on design systems and experiences for large scale products. Currently based in Warsaw, Poland. Looking to join a team.</h5>
    
    <p><figure><img src="/images/about/profile-small.jpg" alt=""></figure></p>

<h3 id="history">History</h3>

<p>Its started out as a hobby when I got into print design and typography. So, I took a course in graphic design and learned the basics of color, composition, typography, and how to apply it in branding. Then, around 5 years ago, I got obsessed with web design, took a quick course and shortly after that I started doing it for a living. Over the course on the next few years I gradually transitioned into UI/UX. I realised I could create more value when I spent more time doing that.</p>

<p>Now I'm thinking through design systems and designing experiences for large scale products.</p>

<p>I've been a freelancer since 2014 and so far I've been mostly working with startups in Europe and the US.</p>

<h3 id="my-approach">My approach</h3>

<p>I enjoy good design in all its forms and try to bring it into my life and work. To me simplicity and functionality are the most important qualities in digital experiences. And, of course, there must be a human element to it, so when the most important qualities are in place I try to make the experience delightful as well.</p>

<p>I apply motion in interaction design. It helps make the experience intuitive. Hence, more potential to be used and provide value. For a more detailed insight into how I do what I do here's a post about <a href="/posts/post_1">My Workflow</a>.</p>

<p>I can humbly do what is needed for the project at any given moment, but I'm always concerned with a reason behind it. Recently, increasingly so. Knowing the reason and having a good one just helps me sit down to work. Also, it's probably the only way to do a good design.</p>

<p>I am a designer, but I also do a bit of development. I am experienced with CSS/SASS, HTML and basic JS for interactions and prototyping. I've done a great deal of prototyping in Framer. I am most comfortable working alongside developers.</p>

<h3 id="in-my-free-time">In my free time</h3>

<p>I'm <strong>learning to make music</strong>. This is something I never thought I would do, but thanks to technology and good design everyone with a phone or a tablet can make a beat and layer a simple melody on top. It's how I got into design after all.</p>

<p><strong>I read</strong> with particular interest about evolution, integral theory, human interaction,  geopolitics, psychology, common good,  sustainable future, happiness, friendship, health and longevity. Occasionally, I read fiction when I don't have an itching feeling of not having some answers.</p>

<p>I have an unintentional habit of <strong>taking pictures</strong>. I've yet to find out what to do with them after they've been taken and edited.</p>

<p><strong>Cooking</strong>. I thought, since I'm gonna have to do it for the rest of my life, why not learn to have a delightful meal regardless of where I am and whether or not there's my favourite breakfast spot down the street. I'm lucky to also enjoy this process.</p>

<p>Every once in a while I <strong>write something</strong> to keep track of my thoughts. But also I just generally like to take simple notes when I'm working, learning, or going about my daily errands.</p>

<p><strong>Cycling</strong>. It just brings me joy. Bicycle is my main means of transportation.</p>
