### Small House Big Door

As I’ve said before, I adore Park Hyatt Seoul but it does come with a hefty tag. If you’re on a budget, Small House Big Door is an acceptable choice. I primarily hate staying at hotels because so many of them are designed with no taste. SHBD may not be as clean, comfortable, and sleek as I’d like but it does have a sense of design, which seems to be a rarity. The rooms are clinically unadorned and have fun little touches like 3D printed keys and lamps. The hotels is also excellent in terms of location, with a subway station at its doorstep and just a 5 minute walk to Myeong-dong. Even if you’re on a budget, your eyes don’t deserve to be terrorized by tacky hotel decor. Go to Small House Big Door.

### Auprés

###### ★★★★
{.text-muted .mb-4}
###### $$

Being in Seoul, I didn’t think my most memorable dining experience was going to be at a French restaurant, but it was.  Auprés is a reasonably priced yet truly capable French restaurant with truly world-class dishes. The flavors are classic french, but with a light and fresh overtone. Everything was magnificent from the celeriac soup to the chicken stuffed with foie gras and mushrooms. Along with the stunning dishes, Auprés has a calm, soothing mood that makes it ideal for a date or a long dinner with a close friend. The mussel and paprika salad was a particularly notable dish and is a must-have if you visit.

### Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP)

###### ★★☆☆

###### $

Philosophically, I’m on the opposite side of the spectrum from Zaha Hadid, but I must admit, the massive Dongdaemun Design Plaza is an impressive thing to see in person. The DDP features exhibition halls, historic artifacts, and shops but there isn’t necessarily much substance there, so visit primarily for the architecture like myself. Be sure to go at night when the entire structure is lit from the inside-out and the tacky plastic rose garden transforms into a sea of lights. The DDP has instantly become of Seoul’s most iconic landmarks so it’s worth a visit if you haven’t been. It really isn’t as tacky as you might think.

### Alegria Coffee Roasters

###### $$

When you’re at Common Ground and annoyed by the curation of shops, head over to Algeria Coffee Roasters on the rooftop. They roast their own beans, have a solid menu, and the baristas seem to know what they’re doing. They also showcase new roasts on a seasonal basis, which is fun for the regular. There’s a pretty good cold brew on the menu too, which isn’t super common in Seoul yet. The seating is uncomfortable but you should honestly just enjoy the coffee and move on to a more interesting neighborhood.

### Mikkeller

###### 강남구 신사동 544-22

###### ★★☆☆
{.text-muted .mb-4}
###### $$$

Mikkeller is a microbrewery from Copenhagen that’s well known for its unique collaborations. The Seoul location was launched recently and offers an impressive selection of beers on tap. First impressions were nice, with a playful interior sprinkled with fantastic illustrations Mikkeller is so well known for. I tried three different beers here and unfortunately didn’t enjoy any of them, as I found them too complex and fruity. That being said, I’m not a big fan of beer to begin with, so if you like beer, Mikkeller might be a different experience for you. I really did think the atmosphere really was spectacular though. I just wished it was a whiskey bar.
