This is not my first personal website. I realised that I needed a once well done website, that serve my needs long-term, be easy to update with new content, be cheap.

### Built with
This is my personal website that I made using templating system called Hugo and I'm hosting the website here on Github Pages.

### Type
Typeset in Matthew Butterick’s Equity. Besides being an outstanding typeface (loosely based on Stanley Morison’s Ehrhardt), Equity is sold under the best font license I’ve seen so far—it’s just 1 page and it lets you do pretty much anything you want with the fonts (besides reselling them of course).

### Hosted
Hosted on DigitalOcean. If you’d like to try DigitalOcean, you can use this link to get $10 credit. It’s an affiliate link, so I get credit if you use it to sign up. Thus far my experience with them has been great. DigitalOcean obviously caters for advanced users—server management is done through the command line—so if that’s not something you’re familiar with then this might not be for you.
