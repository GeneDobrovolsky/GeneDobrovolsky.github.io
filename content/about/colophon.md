### Built

I made it using a static site generator called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) - speed, security, simplicity. Nice blogging framework, requires a bit of coding, though.

### Hosted

I'm hosting it on Github Pages straight from a repository on GitHub for free.

### Type

Typeset in [Runda](http://cargocollective.com/pstype/Runda). It has the clarity and confidence that I think compliments my work.
