This is not my first personal website. After a few years of having one that I updated maybe 2 or 3 times in a year I realised it was a bit of an overkill. 

My previous website was on Wordpress and hosted on Mediatemple wich cost me 20$/month + 15$/year for the domain + throwing in 50$/year Typekit subscription, which is optional, but it was the case.
  
So, I was paying around $300 a year for something that was nice to have, but optional, since I was getting my jobs on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com) or from my previous clients and their connections.

I needed a better solution â€“ simple website that would serve my needs long-term, one that would be easy to update with new content once it was set up, and a cheap one.

### Built with
I made it using a static site generator called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) - speed, security, simplicity. Nice blogging framework, but requires a bit of coding.

### Hosted
I'm hosting it on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) straight from my website repository on GitHub for free.

### Type
Typeset in [Runda](http://cargocollective.com/pstype/Runda). It has the clarity and confidence that I think compliments my work. Once my Typekit subscription ends I'll just invest in 2 weights of the font if I decide to stick with it. 

### The Result
15$/year for somewhere to host my case studies and general info. Fajnie.
