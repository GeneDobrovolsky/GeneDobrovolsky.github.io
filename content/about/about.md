### My approach

Functionality and simplicity. I believe, a great tool should feel like an extension of ourselves that helps us complete a task with as little effort as possible and at the same time help us enjoy the process. Like a well-designed set of kitchen tools and a balanced sharp knife can make our experience of making dinner relaxing and delightful.

Quality and details. I believe user experience is inseparable from the visual aspect of a digital product. So, I start from the core of UX and finish with the fine visual details. I put a lot of care into details and make my designs with precision.

Time. I like to think of design as my favorite hobby that gives me energy and adds quality to my life. My method has been taking shape over years and I've realized that I'm producing the best results while I'm enjoying the process at my own pace, consistently making inputs that over time build up into a whole.

### Experience

I have over 4 years of experience working remotely with startups and 2 years as an in-house designer focusing on e-commerce solutions. 
Over those years I designed admin dashboards and mobile apps, online stores, landing pages and marketing materials. Also, I've built and maintained quite a few design systems.

Usually, those were large-scale projects lasting from 1 to 2,5 years. Such time frames allowed me to design digital products in a holistic way and with a long-term vision.

I am a designer, but I started out as a front-end developer, so I understand how my designs are going to be implemented. I know how I need to structure and document them for the most efficient design-development collaboration.

### Spare time

I like to explore other areas of design as well as look into adjacent domains of creativity like architecture and urban planning, engineering, space. 

When I'm not reading fiction I dig into evolution, philosophy, psychology. I find it fascinating to learn about systems and patterns in the universe.

Hiking with a backpack and a tent once a few moths had become usual during my years as a full-time in-house designer.

Cooking. I really enjoy the process and the sharing. Also, I thought, since I'm gonna have to eat for the rest of my life, why not learn how to make a decent meal.

For years bicycle has been my means of transportation and a great source of pleasure. I love it.
