The average employee spends 37% of their work time in meetings. When those meetings are ineffective, that adds up to a lot of wasted time and money.

FirstAgenda has taken a stand against unproductive meetings by developing the digital meeting solutions Prepare and Assistant. Their focus is to optimize all stages in the process of preparing for, organizing and following up on meetings.

### Assistant

Assistant is focused on helping you during the meeting.

- **Record entire meeting**
	- relisten
	- add bookmarks
	- search mentioned words – recordings are transcribed 
- **Use speech recognition or type up**
	- personal notes
	- public decisions
	- public tasks, assign to attendees
- **Add photos**

### Prepare

Prepare on the iPad and Web helps you before and after meetings.

- **Upload documents**
	- highlight text
	- add notes
	- leave comments, collaborate with meeting attendees
- **Access and edit everything added with Assistant**

### The early days

I joined the team in mid 2016 when there already was a web and an iPad app called Prepare that managed the basics of preparing before the meeting and collaborating after: meeting dates, attendees, attachments and documents, document comments and notes. 

{.col-md-8 .col-xl-6 .border .p-0}![](/images/work_5/3.png "It's a meeting page in Prepare app on an iPad, early 2016.  The web counterpart was identical and had the same functionality.")

At that moment First Agenda already had 30K active users in 400 organisations across Scandinavia wich amounted to 10K monthly meetings. Now First Agenda wanted to provide a tool for when you were in a meeting - Assistant. 

I started with Assistant, but later when we figured out the basic functionality and had a working prototype we started to think of it as a part of a one whole product and I was responsible for the UI/UX of it. 

First Agenda received $17 Mill at some point after we rolled out our early version of Assistant and overhauled Prepare on the web. I continued to move the design towards a finished product.

### The details
We've been through a lot of iteration and exploration. Eventually we stuck with the designs that would align with the Android and web app, although if we were working on just an iOS app we would probably go with the FA iPhone 2b or similar. It's important that the user feels at home and the home is consistent throughout all devices.

The main flow is super simple. You start on your meetings list > go to meeting > everything you need is within one scroll.
