The average employee spends 37% of their work time in meetings. When those meetings are ineffective, that adds up to a lot of wasted time and money.

At FirstAgenda, we have taken a stand against unproductive meetings by developing the digital meeting solutions Prepare and Assistant. Our focus is to optimize all stages in the process of preparing for, organizing and following up on meetings. 
 
With more than 35,000 active users, from both the public and private sectors, and 150,000 meetings held using FirstAgenda’s solutions, we’re proud to say that we are Scandinavia’s leading provider of meeting solutions.


### The early days

I joined the team in mid 2016 when there already was an MVP. It was a web and an iPad app managing the basics of preparing before the meeting and collaborating after: meeting dates, attendees, attachments and documents, document comments and notes. It was functional and First Agenda already had a XXX client base, so now they wanted to provide a tool for when you’re in a meeting - Assistant. I started with that.

In the beginning we were working on it as a separate app, but later when we figured out the basic functionality and had a working prototype we started to think of it as a part of an acosystem: iPhone and iPad apps, Android app, web app (mobile, tablet, laptop+). So now I was responsible for the UI/UX of the entire product.

First Agenda recieved $17 Mill at some point when we rolled out our early version of the ecosystem. I continued to move the deisgn towards a finished product.

### A simple approach, today
Here I tell about how the ecosystem actually works with simplifying illustrations of the functionality.
