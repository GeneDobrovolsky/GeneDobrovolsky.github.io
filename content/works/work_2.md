Tripopotamus was to be a one-stop-shop web travel platform that would allow to combine different components to create one's own perfect vacation. 

Research shows that the path to purchase is complex, and traveler search activity is intensifying, an average customer making 32.5 visits to 10.3 websites before the order. Tripopotamus wanted to simplify this process believing that you need to spend less time on planning trips and more enjoying it.

### How it started

I joined the startup in the very beginning in 2015 and stuck around for about 8 months. It was intense ðŸ˜…. All design was on me, with UI/UX being the most important, of course. We were ideating â†’ designing â†’ building â†’ iterating + trying to raise funds at the same time, wich also required quite a bit of design work.

I was working closely with the CEO Dasha Paley - the mastermind, and later on with the developer - Max, who was making my designs come to life.

### Identity

When we started we had a logo of a hippo wich is on the left, and since we needed a quick decent enough identity that would serve our ambitious plan to deliver a full travel experience, we made it customisable.

	</figure>
</div>

We also used a unique color for the main UIs of every individual travel service we were planning to provide: 
- Packages
- Hotels 
- Flights
- Trains
- Cars
- Cruises
- Experiences

### The outside
We came up with a flexible home page model that we could also apply to every service. I created a collection of home page modules for different screen sizes.

### The insides
The insides of course were the most challenging.   We needed to basically learn from all the individual online travel services and combine them into one platform providing great, consistent UX  while addressing the individual needs of every kind of travel service, from hotels, to trains.

Our plan was to figure out the most used travel services like hotels and flights first and  package them throwing in the rest of the services like cars and cruises as placeholders due to fast pace and limited resources.

We were iterating and changing quite a lot on the go trying to figure out the best solutions, so that a functional prototype would be ready once we get an investment and meet our first bunch of customers.

And since Tripopotamus was planned as a web-based service we had to make sure that everything was just as good on mobile as it was on the web.

I also got to work on a little bit of the fancy stuff too.

	</figure>

</div>

Unfortunately, Tripopotamus didn't make it, but I personally learned a lot from it, so it was totally worth it.
