Domesting develops mobile and web based platform that connects users to commercial and residential cleaning companies. The platform allows users to find and book services for domestic cleaning, cleaning of communities, office cleaning, cleaning of the commercial premises, cleaning in educational centers, garage cleaning, and industrial cleaning and sanitation. 

I was at Domesting for about 6 months from almost the very beginning doing branding, UI/UX, front-end, print and just like it often happens in startups trying to help the ream succeed in every way I could.

It was a team of 3 people: Pablo the CEO, Carlos the CTO and me. We working hard trying to develop and then improve on our MVP. The challenge for me was just sheer amount of work that needed to be done while keeping the quality at a reasonable level. 

I moved on some 6 month later when the foundation was laid and it was now time to raise money, invest into marketing and expand the client base.
